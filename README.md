# BibleVirst
Bible Application with daily bible versus and easy search and storing function for your favourite verse!

This application was made for my final project for Harvard's CS50 course in 2020.

From the lessons learned in mobile development in Java, I adapted what they taught about parsing APIs and CRUDE opertations to create this app.
